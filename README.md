Three approaches to improve performance on the TRIP benchmark: transfer learning, model selection, and fine-tuning

We implement three approaches to improve reasoning on the TRIP Benchmark mainly based on two previous papers, TRIP (https://aclanthology.org/2021.findings-emnlp.422/) and HAR ()

## Approach 1: Transfer Learning with BERT
Model: “google-bert/bert-large-uncased”    

Datasets fot transfer learning: \
1)Conversational Entailment (CE) ; \
2)Physical Interaction: Question and Answering (PIQA)

Results and Discussion: \


## Approach 2: Model Selection: Use Large Language Model

## Approach 3: Prompting Techniques
