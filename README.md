Three approaches to improve performance on the TRIP benchmark: transfer learning, model selection, and fine-tuning

We implement three approaches to improve reasoning on the TRIP Benchmark:

## Approach 1: Transfer Learning  
Model: “google-bert/bert-large-uncased”    
Datasets fot transfer learning: \
1)Conversational Entailment (CE) ; \
2)Physical Interaction: Question and Answering (PIQA)

## Approach 2: Model Selection 

## Approach 3: Prompting Techniques
