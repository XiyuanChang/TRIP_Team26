Three approaches to improve performance on the TRIP benchmark: transfer learning, model selection, and fine-tuning

We implement three approaches to improve reasoning on the TRIP Benchmark:

Approach 1: Transfer Learning 

     Model: “google-bert/bert-large-uncased”  
     
     Datasets: Conversational Entailment (CE)¹ \
               Physical Interaction: Question and Answering (PIQA)²

Approach 2: Model Selection 

Approach 3: Prompting Techniques
